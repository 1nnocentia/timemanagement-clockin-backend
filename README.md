### Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/1nnocentia/timemanagement-clockin-backend.git

# Configure database
# Start XAMPP MySQL service
# Database 'clockin' will be auto-created

# Run application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**API Base URL:** `http://localhost:8080/api`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to back up important data first before making changes to the database. Deleting a database will permanently delete all existing data.

### Common Issues

**XAMPP Not Running**
- **Problem:** Application fails to connect to database
- **Solution:** Ensure XAMPP is running and MySQL service is active
- **Check:** Verify MySQL is accessible at `localhost:3306`

**Java Version Mismatch**
- **Problem:** Build fails or application won't start
- **Solution:** Ensure your Java version matches the one specified in `pom.xml`
- **Check:** Verify you're using Java 17+ as specified in the project configuration

> [!TIP]
> If you experience recurring issues, try clearing the Maven cache by running `mvn clean install`, then restarting your IDE.
